### US-001: Define task domain model and validation utilities
Status: in_progress
Depends on: None

Description:
As a developer, I want a typed task model and validation helpers so task behavior is consistent and testable across UI actions.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Create TypeScript task model and helper functions for create/update/toggle/delete-safe operations
- [ ] Validation rejects empty or whitespace-only task titles and titles longer than 120 chars
- [ ] Example: input '  Pay rent  ' is normalized to 'Pay rent' and accepted
- [ ] Negative case: input '   ' returns validation error and task is not created
- [ ] Run quality gates: npm run lint and npm run build
