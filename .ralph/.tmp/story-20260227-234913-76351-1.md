### US-002: Implement local persistence repository for tasks
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-001

Description:
As a user, I want my tasks to persist after refresh so I do not lose progress.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Implement read/write task persistence to localStorage with a stable storage key
- [ ] Repository returns empty list when storage key is missing
- [ ] Example: saving two tasks and refreshing loads the same two tasks
- [ ] Negative case: corrupted JSON in storage is handled gracefully by returning [] and avoiding runtime crash
- [ ] Run quality gates: npm run lint and npm run build
