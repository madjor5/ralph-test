### US-003: Build todo UI on root route with core create and list flows
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-001, US-002

Description:
As a user, I want a clear home screen for creating and viewing tasks so I can manage my todos quickly.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Route / renders Todo Home with components: header, task input form, task list, and empty-state message
- [ ] Submitting valid input creates a new task and renders it immediately in the list
- [ ] UI states on / include: empty list state before tasks exist, populated state after creation, and inline validation error state for invalid input
- [ ] Example: entering 'Finish report' and submitting displays a new unchecked task row
- [ ] Negative case: submitting an empty title keeps list unchanged and shows validation feedback
- [ ] Run quality gates: npm run lint and npm run build
