### US-004: Add complete/incomplete toggling and status filters
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-003

Description:
As a user, I want to mark tasks complete and filter by status so I can focus on remaining work.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Each task row includes a checkbox/button to toggle completed state
- [ ] Filter controls support all, active, and completed views on route /
- [ ] Active filter state is visually distinct and list updates without full page reload
- [ ] Example: with 3 tasks (2 completed), selecting 'Active' shows only the 1 incomplete task
- [ ] Negative case: selecting 'Completed' when none are completed shows empty filtered-state message, not a crash
- [ ] Run quality gates: npm run lint and npm run build
