### US-005: Enable edit and delete task actions
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-003

Description:
As a user, I want to update or remove tasks so my list stays accurate.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Each task row provides edit and delete controls on route /
- [ ] Edit flow allows updating title while preserving task id and createdAt
- [ ] Delete flow removes task from UI and persistence layer
- [ ] Example: editing 'Call bank' to 'Call bank at 3pm' updates the same task row
- [ ] Negative case: attempting to save edit with blank title shows validation error and keeps prior value
- [ ] Run quality gates: npm run lint and npm run build
