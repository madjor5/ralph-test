### US-006: Add task summary and clear-completed action
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-004, US-005

Description:
As a user, I want a quick summary and bulk cleanup so I can manage completed work efficiently.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Route / shows summary counts for total, active, and completed tasks
- [ ] Provide clear-completed action that removes only completed tasks
- [ ] After clear-completed, filters and counts remain accurate
- [ ] Example: with 5 tasks (3 completed), clear-completed leaves 2 active tasks
- [ ] Negative case: triggering clear-completed when zero completed tasks performs no-op without error
- [ ] Run quality gates: npm run lint and npm run build
